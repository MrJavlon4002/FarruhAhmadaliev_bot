def split_text(text, chunk_size=800, overlap_sentences=1, separators=['\n\n', '.\n', ':\n', '\n', '.']):
    """
    Split text into chunks of size less than chunk_size, ensuring that each chunk is meaningful and retains context.
    If a paragraph is smaller than chunk_size, it is treated as a single chunk.
    If a paragraph is larger than chunk_size, it is split into parts while preserving context.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to split.
        chunk_size (int): The maximum size of each chunk.
        overlap_sentences (int): The number of overlapping sentences between successive chunks.
        separators (list): A list of separators to use for splitting.

    Returns:
        list: A list of text chunks.
